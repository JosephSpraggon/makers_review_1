School reports Company

help teachers to find out how students did on tests

get a string of comma seperated values these are test results

build a simple report on top of those

teachers do get tired and sometimes input with incorrect casing -- input can is case insentive &  we would like the output to have correct capitalisation.

teachers do get tired and sometimes: if values are not green, amber, red they can be classified under 'Uncounted'.

*examples*

"Green, Green, Red, Amber, Red" => "Green: 2\nAmber: 1\nRed: 2"

"Green,Dave,White,Red" => "Green: 1\nRed: 1\nUncounted: 2"
